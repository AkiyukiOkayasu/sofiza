# SoFiZa

An SFZ format parser


## Implementation progress

The only implemented opcodes for now are the ones necessary to parse the
sfz files present in the following free (as in freedom) musical libraries:

- [Versilian Studios Chamber Orquestra 2 (Community Edition)](https://vis.versilstudios.com/vsco-community.html)
  - [VSCO-2-CE-1.1.0](https://github.com/sgossner/VSCO-2-CE)
- [Versilian Community Sample Library](https://vis.versilstudios.com/vcsl.html)
  - [VCSL-1.2.2-RC](https://github.com/sgossner/VCSL)
- [Virtual Playing Orchestra Free Sample Library](http://virtualplaying.com/)
- [Salamander Grand Piano v3](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/3)
- [SCC Taiko Drums](http://www.schristiancollins.com/vi-percussion.php)


## Future plans

My intention is to provide conversion to Csound code, which will allow to
create samplers, among other things.
